//! `NativeLoader` - loads and hot-reloads a plugin dylib.
//!
//! Uses native Rust ABI (no C translation layer). Verifies
//! compatibility via `AbiCanary` + symbol presence before use. The
//! dylib exports a flat set of functions over an opaque `*mut ()` state
//! pointer (see `export_plugin!`); the loader resolves them into
//! [`LogicSymbols`]. The DSP state itself is owned by the shell
//! ([`crate::shell::HotShell`]), not the loader, so it can survive a
//! reload - the loader only swaps the code.
