//! Hot-reload mechanics for truce: dylib loading, ABI canary, and the
//! shells (`HotShell<P, S>`, `StaticShell<P, L, S>`) that bridge the
//! user-facing `truce_plugin::PluginLogic` / `truce_plugin::PluginLogic64`
//! leaf traits onto [`truce_core::PluginRuntime`] for format wrappers.
//!
//! Plugin authors don't reach into this crate directly. They write
//! `impl PluginLogic for MyPlugin` (the leaf trait is sample-pinned
//! via the prelude re-export) and the `truce::plugin!` macro picks
//! the static or hot shell based on the `shell` Cargo feature.
//!
//! # ABI boundary
//!
//! `PluginLogic` is a stateless descriptor with a separate `type DspState`,
//! so the DSP state can live in the *shell* rather than the reloadable
//! dylib. The dylib exports a flat set of Rust-ABI functions
//! (`export_plugin!`) over an opaque `*mut ()` state pointer (an erased
//! `Box<State>`) plus the shell's `Arc<Params>` pointer. `HotShell` owns
//! the state and, on a reload, carries it into the new code by a save /
//! load round-trip through the plugin's persistence blob (when
//! `PRESERVE_DSP_STATE` is set) - so a reverb tail survives the swap
//! whenever the plugin serializes it - and re-inits otherwise.
//! `StaticShell` holds a typed `L::DspState` directly.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use truce_loader::{AbiCanary, PluginLogic, PluginLogicCore};
//!
//! struct MyPlugin;                 // stateless descriptor
//! impl PluginLogic for MyPlugin { type DspState = MyState; /* ... */ }
//!
//! // Emitted by `truce::plugin!` (plugin authors don't write these).
//! // `Sample` resolves through the prelude alias (`f32` for `prelude` /
//! // `prelude32` / `prelude64m`, `f64` for `prelude64`).
