//! ABI canary - runtime verification that shell and dylib have
//! compatible type layouts across the hot-reload boundary. The dylib
//! exports a flat set of Rust-ABI symbols over an opaque state pointer
//! (no trait object), so this checks the sizes / layouts those symbols
//! pass by value or reference, plus the rustc build hash and sample
//! precision. Whether the plugin opts into DSP-state carry-over rides a
//! separate `truce_preserve_dsp_state` symbol, not this struct.

/// Hand-bumped ABI epoch. Sizes and alignments can't see every
/// layout change: `Event::port` landed in former padding, so
/// `event_size` stayed the same while a stale shell would read
/// uninitialized padding as the port. Bump this when any
/// boundary-crossing type changes layout invisibly to the size /
/// align fields below. When `AbiCanary` itself gains or loses a
/// field, bump the *export symbol* version instead
/// (`truce_abi_canary_vN`) - the canary crosses the boundary by
/// value, so two different canary layouts must never call each
/// other.
///
/// Epoch 2: `Event` grew `port: u8` in former padding (multi-port
/// MIDI).
/// Epoch 3: `editor` left the `PluginLogicCore` vtable (it moved to the
/// receiverless `truce_build_editor` export). The slot's removal shifts
/// every later vtable index, so a stale epoch-2 dylib would bind
/// `save_state` / `latency` / `tail` to the wrong slots and lacks the
/// new symbol; this bump rejects it cleanly at the canary instead of
/// relying on the probe to notice the misalignment.
/// Epoch 4: `reset` takes `&AudioConfig` instead of `(f64, usize)`, and
/// `ProcessContext` gained a `process_mode` field. A stale epoch-3 dylib
/// would call `reset` with mismatched arguments and read a differently
/// sized context; this bump rejects it before either can happen.
/// Epoch 5: the dylib boundary stopped being a `dyn PluginLogicCore`
/// vtable and became a flat set of Rust-ABI symbols over an opaque
/// `*mut ()` state pointer (state now lives in the shell, so it can
/// survive a code-only reload). The vtable probe is gone; a stale
/// epoch-4 dylib exports the old `truce_create` shape and lacks the new
/// symbols, so it fails at `dlsym` - this bump rejects it earlier and
/// with a clearer message.
/// Epoch 6: adds the `truce_snapshot_version` export (the generation
/// token that lets the shell skip re-serializing an unchanged snapshot).
/// A stale epoch-5 dylib lacks the symbol; this bump rejects it at the
/// canary before symbol resolution fails.
