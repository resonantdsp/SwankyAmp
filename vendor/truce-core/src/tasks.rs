//! Managed background-task pool.
//!
//! A process-global pool of worker threads runs plugin
//! `BackgroundTask::run` handlers off the audio thread. Each plugin
//! instance owns a
//! preallocated, wait-free inbound queue via a [`TaskSpawner`]: the
//! audio thread (or the editor, or `init`) pushes tasks without
//! allocating or blocking, and a pool worker drains them. Feedback to
//! the audio thread stays the plugin's job through shared `#[skip]`
//! channels - the pool owns only the worker threads and the inbound
//! queue.
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! By default drains are **not** mutually exclusive: the stranding-
//! avoidance handshake clears a sink's `scheduled` flag before draining,
//! so a burst that re-arms an instance mid-drain can hand a second idle
//! worker the same sink - `run` can run concurrently with itself for
//! one instance. Handlers must therefore be reentrancy-safe: talk to the
//! audio thread only through lock-free / atomic channels (the reverb
//! example's MPMC handoff), or guard shared mutable state (the
//! `AudioTap::drain_with` `try_lock` idiom). A plugin that can't meet that
//! contract sets `BackgroundTask::SERIALIZED = true`, and the pool then
//! runs that instance's handler one at a time.
//!
//! The pool is shared across every instance in the process (one small
//! set of threads, not one thread per instance) and initializes lazily
//! the first time any instance actually schedules a task, so a plugin
//! that never declares a `BackgroundTask` spawns no threads.
//!
//! Because the pool is shared and small (`available_parallelism() - 1`,
//! as few as one thread), task handlers must stay short and
//! non-blocking: one plugin that blocks on I/O or a lock stalls every
//! other instance's background work. Long or blocking work belongs on a
//! plugin's own thread (`AudioTap::spawn_worker`), not the pool.

// Gated on `not(miri)` to match `pin_current_module`, which is a no-op
// under Miri (no dynamic loader to pin), so these FFI types aren't used.
