/// `PluginRuntime` is the surface every format wrapper (CLAP, VST3,
/// VST2, LV2, AU, AAX) consumes. The `truce::plugin!` macro generates
/// an `impl PluginRuntime for __HotShellWrapper` from the user's
/// `truce_plugin::PluginLogic` impl, bridging the user-facing trait
/// into this GUI-free format-wrapper surface so `truce-core` doesn't
/// pull in `truce-gui` types.
///
/// What plugin authors implement instead:
///
/// ```ignore
/// impl truce::prelude::PluginLogic for MyPlugin {
///     type Params = MyPluginParams;
///     fn reset(&mut self, config: &AudioConfig) { /* ... */ }
///     fn process(&mut self, /* ... */) -> ProcessStatus { /* ... */ }
///     fn editor(params: Arc<MyPluginParams>) -> Box<dyn Editor> { /* ... */ }
/// }
///
/// truce::plugin! { logic: MyPlugin, params: MyPluginParams }
/// ```

/// to the user's impl.
