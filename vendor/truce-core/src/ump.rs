//! Universal MIDI Packet (UMP) codec for MIDI 2.0 channel-voice
//! messages.
//!
//! UMP is the MIDI 2.0 wire format. Channel-voice 2.0 messages live
//! in 64-bit packets: word 0 carries `mt | group | status |
//! channel | <status-specific 16 bits>`, word 1 carries the
//! status-specific value (velocity + attribute, controller value,
//! pitch-bend, etc.). Many UMP transports embed 64-bit packets in a
//! fixed 128-bit slot, so [`decode_ump_channel_voice_2`] and
//! [`encode_ump_channel_voice_2`] work in terms of `[u32; 4]` with the
//! upper two words zeroed for channel-voice. Encoding is gated behind a
//! port's declared [`crate::MidiDialect::Midi2`] so a MIDI-1.0 host
//! never receives UMP.
//!
//! Spec reference: MIDI 2.0 M2-104-UM §4.1.
//!
//! Format wrappers that speak UMP (AU v3 on macOS 12+ / iOS 15+ via
//! `MIDIEventList`, CLAP's `CLAP_EVENT_MIDI2`) call into here so the
//! channel-voice + `SysEx` codecs aren't reimplemented per wrapper.
//!
//! MIDI 1.0 channel voice over UMP (mt 0x2) has an *encoder*
//! ([`encode_ump_channel_voice_1`]) for emitting 1.0 events on a
//! 2.0-protocol transport; there's no mt-0x2 decoder yet (wrappers
//! receive 1.0 as bytes). Out of scope: utility (mt 0x0), system
//! real-time (mt 0x1), flex-data (mt 0xD), UMP stream (mt 0xF).
//! `SysEx`-7 (mt 0x3) has both the assembler and an encoder
//! ([`encode_sysex7_packet`]); `SysEx`-8 / data (mt 0x5) has the
//! assembler only; everything else awaits demand.
