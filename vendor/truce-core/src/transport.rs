//! Shared transport slot: audio-thread writer → editor-thread reader.
//!
//! Each format wrapper owns a [`TransportSlot`] and writes it at the
//! top of every process block. The editor closure on
//! [`crate::editor::PluginContext`] reads from the same slot, giving
//! UI code access to host tempo / play state / beat position without
//! a format-specific callback.
//!
//! The implementation is a single-writer seqlock: the audio thread's
//! write path takes no locks and always lands; UI readers retry on
//! collision (the critical section is a single `TransportInfo` copy,
//! a few hundred nanoseconds at worst). A mutex-based design would
//! either drop audio-thread writes on contention (`try_lock`) or
//! introduce audio-thread blocking, both of which would let the
//! visualizer drift from real transport state.
