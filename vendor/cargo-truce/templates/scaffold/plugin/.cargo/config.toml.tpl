# Local build-environment config. Gitignored - set your own values.
# `cargo truce install` and `cargo truce package` both read from here.
#
# Cargo injects everything in `[env]` into the environment of any
# subcommand it spawns, so values here are visible to `cargo truce`
# without further plumbing. See https://truce.audio/ for the full
# list of env vars truce understands.

[env]
# --- macOS code signing ---
# TRUCE_SIGNING_IDENTITY           = "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"

# --- macOS notarization (set [macos.packaging].notarize = true in truce.toml) ---
# Either set up a keychain profile (preferred):
#     xcrun notarytool store-credentials TRUCE_NOTARY

# --- Windows Authenticode signing ---
# Pick ONE of: Azure Trusted Signing, cert thumbprint, or .pfx file.

# Azure Trusted Signing:
