//! User-facing plugin traits + internal bridge.
//!
//! This crate is the plugin author's entry point. The single
//! `impl PluginLogic for MyPlugin { ... }` block covers both
//! audio-thread DSP and main-thread GUI, with sample precision
//! routed through the prelude (see `truce::prelude` /
//! `truce::prelude64`).
//!
//! `truce-plugin` depends on `truce-gui-types` (light: layout,
//! render trait, widget regions) - not the full `truce-gui`.
//! Plugin authors who supply a custom editor (egui, iced, slint,
//! raw window handle) end up with `truce-plugin` in their dep
//! tree but not the built-in editor's tiny-skia + baseview +
//! truce-font stack.
//!
//! ## Three traits, one source of truth
//!
//! - [`PluginLogic`]   - what plugin authors implement for `f32`-buffer plugins.
//! - [`PluginLogic64`] - what plugin authors implement for `f64`-buffer plugins.
//! - [`PluginLogicCore`] - generic-over-`S` trait the format wrappers consume.
//!
//! Plus one layer of sugar: [`PurePluginLogic`] / [`PurePluginLogic64`]
//! for plugins with no DSP state, blanket-implemented into the
//! matching leaf so everything downstream sees a normal `PluginLogic`
//! with `DspState = ()`.
//!
//! The two leaf traits are stamped from one
//! `plugin_logic_leaf_trait!` `macro_rules!` definition (further
//! down this file) so their method surfaces stay in lock-step. Each leaf
//! gets a blanket impl that forwards every method to
//! `PluginLogicCore<S>` with the matching `S`. Wrappers
//! (`StaticShell`, `HotShell`, the format crates) bind on
//! `PluginLogicCore<S>` and don't care which leaf the user impl'd.
//!
//! ## What this buys
//!
//! Plugin authors writing `impl PluginLogic for Synth { ... }`
//! never name a precision. The `truce::prelude64` re-export aliases
//! `PluginLogic64` as `PluginLogic` in the user's scope, so the
//! same impl header reads the same regardless of which prelude is
//! in use. The `<S>` token that used to live on the impl header is
//! gone - the prelude carries the precision choice.
